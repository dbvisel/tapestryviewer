# tapestryviewer

This site is made using [Remix](https://remix.run) and React. There's a deployment on [Netlify](https://tapestryviewer.netlify.app).

To build, run:

```
npm start
```

You might need to install `netlify-cli` and login to Netlify to run it locally.

Data is set up in `/app/tapestryData.js`. Right now that demonstrates creating a few tapestry objects, forking them, adding items to them, and setting publication status. That will be changed to pull in tapestry and item data from a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfdUXGmHdiJ5gcqZn4LdBJuXB0L6QZvKe3Vd7RP33SM/edit?usp=sharing) â€“ this isn't quite working yet, but I'll have instructions for how to add content there.
