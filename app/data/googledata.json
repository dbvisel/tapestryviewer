Now with the situation in the Ukraine, we find ourselves trying to understand what’s happening and the history that led up to it. I’m fascinated to realize how much I’m relying on text — articles, essays, twitter feeds etc. — to provide the nuanced exploration of complex and abstract ideas i’m looking for, practically in real-time.  Video may help me identify with the suffering of the Ukranian people, but it seems to skim along the surface, manipulating emotions rather than digging deep for understanding.</p><p>Yesterday I read four articles, quite different in perspective and even topic, which I thought gave me some insight into what’s going on. What’s remarkable is that when compared to the limited range of voices of the pre-internet era, these four articles are only a tiny fraction of the breathtaking range of voices now available on the internet. And this is right on time because the complexity of the current moment is such that we need a broad array of lenses through which we can look; not that truth is relative, but rather that truth is inevitably a collage of perspectives which depend on the collision of multiple viewpoints.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, I’m putting the four articles here for two reasons. Some of you may find them interesting and worth the read. And also, as a way of connecting to the ongoing conversation about the evolution of media in the networked era. What better time to talk than right now when we’re in the middle of it.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe1"],"hideTitle":true},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe1","title":"New

from the Fire: a Triangle Employee Escapes","content":"<p><em>Ida Seltzer recalls being spared the fate of many of her co-workers during the great Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in March 1911. She had been fired only the before for refusing to work because her father was ill.</em></p><p><strong>Seltzer:</strong> In 1911 I went into work to the Triangle and at that time, I made there already $12 a week. The shop there, was tremendous, it was three or four flights. In the shop, you know, we were piecework. It was very, very hard work. And it was in a terrible, terrible sweatshop. It was absolutely unbearable. Production there was like, they were standing in the back of you, and watching you every minute, what you worked and they drive like a slave. The doors were locked. No fire escape.</p><p>Every night, when we used to go out of the shop, it used to be a group of girls are there from the shop, like you know, hired that they should examine you, your bosom, your panties, you’re anything, if you don’t take out any lace, or cotton, or a blouse. They used to, the men used to be examined and the women used to be examined.</p><p>At that time, it was on Friday and I couldn’t work overtime — my father was very sick, really sick, he got emphysema and he coughed an awful lot, and I had a lot of problems and couldn’t work, you know, overtime. They expected me to work. So I came to the foreman and I said to him, “I can’t work overtime, I. . . “ He said, “Get out! And don’t come back in tomorrow.” so I didn’t, so I went out . . . </p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How much time of overtime where are you expected to work?</p><p><strong>Seltzer:</strong> well, you hadda work, you used to work from six till eight o’clock. You know, till you get home, it was nine o’clock, because the walking home two hours . . . </p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> and what kind of work did you do there, specifically?</p><p><strong>Seltzer:</strong> Specif . . . a machine. You know, working a machine, blouses. And I came home. And tomorrow was the fire. And that time, I’ll never forget it. I . . . you sit with young people nine months, machine by machine you know. Others, the right machine is from this side, and across the way it was another machine. And you got acquainted for nine months with young people. They had, some of them, had diamond rings - they're supposed to get married in June. The boys used to work daytime and go at night to school and they had the hopes they’ll be an engineer, they’ll be a doctor, they’ll be a lawyer – they’ll be something. You know, young, intelligent children, each and everyone of them, was no dumbbells.</p><p>And the fire broke out. They locked, the doors were locked. There was no fire escape we had to escape, or no door to open. 146 children were burned and not to recognize and except…</p><p>Hundreds and hundreds of people were taken to the hospitals. They spraying from the windows, down, you know? Oh, it was a tragedy for years and years.</p><blockquote><em>The Immigrant Experience</em>, produced by Gail Pellet (New York: WBAI, 1976).</blockquote>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":3,"height":5,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"triangle-shirtwaist-fire","id":"b562e6bf-f62b-4cc3-ac00-56c0aec10ce2","title":"A Century of Women: The Most Influential Events in Twentieth-Century Women's History","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/centuryofwomen00feld/page/49/mode/1up","type":"book","x":4,"y":1,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bob-test","id":"7a5d652b-6971-4d60-b989-f07d264dc4ae","title":"NoahOpinion Substack piece","content":"","url":"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-ukraine-war-and-the-price-of?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNTA2NzA2LCJfIjoiUTdmS2oiLCJpYXQiOjE2NDY3NTM4MTEsImV4cCI6MTY0Njc1NzQxMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM1MzQ1Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.qhcQqCDos9Aem2Hz5hbet_rX4oxS4ve0VqQM_BLl1Ao","type":"web","x":1,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bob-test","id":"7ba617ef-9607-4b57-9207-dfc3359e821d","title":"Future Shock","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/details/futureshocktoff","type":"book","x":2,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bob-test","id":"67667f19-4741-4af5-867f-3ad0bd1ef1ef","title":"Coltrane","content":"","url":"","type":"audio","x":3,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bob-test","id":"6a119f5a-d3f4-41a7-826e-ea750766e8c7","title":"Item 4","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/details/INTERLICHTSPIELHAUS1577531225455","type":"video","x":4,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"this-is-my-title","id":"d4f634d8-177f-4764-8caf-210cf8aa598d","title":"This is my first one","content":"asdfadfasdf","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"this-is-my-title","id":"7cf29a8f-b7e6-43ed-92a3-75120e77635a","title":"Item 2","content":"fasdfasdf","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":3,"y":2,"width":2,"height":1,"linksTo":["d4f634d8-177f-4764-8caf-210cf8aa598d"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"this-is-my-title","id":"dc8d86c4-b983-4ccb-8f92-3c5de37cf688","title":"Item 3","content":"item 3","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":2,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":["7cf29a8f-b7e6-43ed-92a3-75120e77635a"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"new-tapestry","id":"a17b8dab-7ce8-4ae7-b433-5bfd2ec58111","title":"Item 1","content":"This is item 1","url":"https://archive.org/embed/centuryofwomen00feld/page/49/mode/1up","type":"book","x":1,"y":1,"width":3,"height":5,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"new-tapestry","id":"55cbcacf-dd00-44f2-86f3-58dddfb55efa","title":"Item 2","content":"This is item 2","url":"https://archive.org/details/futureshocktoff","type":"web","x":4,"y":2,"width":3,"height":5,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"new-tapestry","id":"fe8fabcb-dadf-4634-ae61-0c0a41453b82","title":"Item 3","content":"","url":"https://tapestryviewer.netlify.app/tapestry/bob-test","type":"web","x":7,"y":1,"width":3,"height":5,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"new-tapestry","id":"f3a2c7b6-616d-4eba-8432-b4b672c51ef9","title":"Item 4","content":"Here is some text.
