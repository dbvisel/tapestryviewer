Now with the situation in the Ukraine, we find ourselves trying to understand what’s happening and the history that led up to it. I’m fascinated to realize how much I’m relying on text — articles, essays, twitter feeds etc. — to provide the nuanced exploration of complex and abstract ideas i’m looking for, practically in real-time.  Video may help me identify with the suffering of the Ukranian people, but it seems to skim along the surface, manipulating emotions rather than digging deep for understanding.</p><p>Yesterday I read four articles, quite different in perspective and even topic, which I thought gave me some insight into what’s going on. What’s remarkable is that when compared to the limited range of voices of the pre-internet era, these four articles are only a tiny fraction of the breathtaking range of voices now available on the internet. And this is right on time because the complexity of the current moment is such that we need a broad array of lenses through which we can look; not that truth is relative, but rather that truth is inevitably a collage of perspectives which depend on the collision of multiple viewpoints.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, I’m putting the four articles here for two reasons. Some of you may find them interesting and worth the read. And also, as a way of connecting to the ongoing conversation about the evolution of media in the networked era. What better time to talk than right now when we’re in the middle of it.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe1"],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe1","title":"New

She had been fired only the before for refusing to work because her father was ill.\n\nSeltzer: in 1911 I went into work to the Triangle and at that time, I made there already $12 a week. The shop there, was tremendous, it was three or four flights. In the shop, you know, we were piecework. It was very, very hard work. And it was in a terrible, terrible sweatshop. It was absolutely unbearable. Production there was like, they were standing in the back of you, and watching you every minute, what you worked and they drive like a slave. The doors were locked. No fire escape. \n\nEvery night, when we used to go out of the shop, it used to be a group of girls are there from the shop, like you know, hired that they should examine you, your bosom, your panties, you’re anything, if you don’t take out any lace, or cotton, or a blouse. They used to, the men used to be examined and the women used to be examined.\n\nAt that time, it was on Friday and I couldn’t work overtime — my father was very sick, really sick, he got emphysema and he coughed an awful lot, and I had a lot of problems and couldn’t work, you know, overtime. They expected me to work. So I came to the foreman and I said to him, “I can’t work overtime, I. . . “ He said, “Get out! And don’t come back in tomorrow.” so I didn’t, so I went out . . . \n\nInterviewer: How much time of overtime where are you expected to work?\n\nSeltzer: well, you hadda work, you used to work from six till eight o’clock. You know, till you get home, it was nine o’clock, because the walking home two hours . . . \n\nInterviewer: and what kind of work did you do there, specifically?\n\nSeltzer: Specif . . . a machine. You know, working a machine, blouses. And I came home. And tomorrow was the fire. And that time, I’ll never forget it. I . . . you sit with young people nine months, machine by machine you know. Others, the right machine is from this side, and across the way it was another machine. And you got acquainted for nine months with young people. They had, some of them, had diamond rings - they're supposed to get married in June. The boys used to work daytime and go at night to school and they had the hopes they’ll be an engineer, they’ll be a doctor, they’ll be a lawyer – they’ll be something. You know, young, intelligent children, each and everyone of them, was no dumbbells. \n\nAnd the fire broke out. They locked, the doors were locked. There was no fire escape we had to escape, or no door to open. 146 children were burned and not to recognize and except…\n\nHundreds and hundreds of people were taken to the hospitals. They spraying from the windows, down, you know? Oh, it was a tragedy for years and years.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience, produced by Gail pellet (New York: WBAI, 1976).","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":3,"height":2,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"67830f6b-0e71-4d7f-b235-17c107b64273","title":"Interview With Ida Seltzer, A Survivor Of The Triangle Fire 1911","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/interview-with-ida-seltzer-a-survivor-of-the-triangle-fire-1911","type":"audio","x":4,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"889711af-f5ea-4a0a-b291-3df64065f7cc","title":"Computers as theatre","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/computersasthea000laur/mode/1up","type":"book","x":4,"y":2,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"58d970c0-429a-440d-a3b8-1bcb85472424","title":"Item 4","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/details/centuryofwomen00feld/page/48/mode/2up?q=triangle+shirtwaist&view=theater","type":"book","x":7,"y":1,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"a4661ed2-5926-4fdf-adcd-6be78815702b","title":"A century of women : the most influential events in twentieth-century women's history","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/centuryofwomen00feld/page/48/mode/2up?q=triangle+shirtwaist&view=theater","type":"book","x":5,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"ff18e960-8956-4b45-95bb-926383ab5ea6","title":"Item 6","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220301202219/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.counterpunch.org%2F2022%2F03%2F01%2Famerica-defeats-germany-for-the-third-time-in-a-century%2F","type":"web","x":1,"y":4,"width":3,"height":6,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"c1a57963-9761-4bb8-b658-b89f6daac76a","title":"first version","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220321085516/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":1,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"8adc6a2e-b802-4c73-a5b3-6d33e278ab9e","title":"March 22","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220322052640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":2,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"47bc3219-af33-473e-b440-d56f8d6b0b70","title":"March 23","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220323231403/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":3,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"microscopes-are-prudent","id":"f9f03a05-eb52-4d97-bba1-669ba669843b","title":"Introduction","content":"<p>I went and searched the Internet Archive for Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Faith is a Fine Invention&quot; curious about how much diversity there might be in the results.

Over the decades Rick rescued 60,000 industrial and educational films, many literally from the dumpster, that together tell a story which is quite different than the &quot;official&quot; Hollywood version. What Rick understood was that the narrative in these &quot;ephemeral&quot; films, which were never intended to be saved for future watching. . . was in many ways a more honest portrayal of the culture than the comedies and dramas on TV and movie screens.</p><p>Rick gave his collection to the Library of Congress and also made much of it available at the Internet Archive. But before that, Rick curated a two-hour collection of films which shine a light on the darkness of mid-20th century American culture.

I was an old yeller even in my youth.  So I did a long series of drawing nights at the Galapagos club in Williamsburg where I would take a text:  say <em>Frankenstein</em> on Halloween and try to draw the room.  Everyone in it.  It had some relation to Joyce and the idea that if you put a focus on anyone on the street there was a novel there.  We are all a great epic story and also I suppose sort of boring and a sameness of crowd. Also if you obscured some or most of the text a randomly generated poem would appear in the margins. It was  maybe Bowie by Burroughs by way of the Dadas….. or the obvious.  Anyway if you knew the book even just a few of the words would glow with the nostalgia of a lost love, or so I supposed.  The DJ said this is so great because no one reads anymore.</p><p>I would attempt to sell these pages for 5 dollars which was the price of a beer at Galapagos. Mostly people just bought me a beer and took a page as souvenir,  or just bought me a  beer and listened to me talk.  There was a large element of performance;  some didacticism,  some advocacy for things I liked.  I hoped people who took a page would feel compelled to read the book it was on.  This was naive I think and not all that many took pages any way so soon I had a large library of drawings.</p><p>I met Bob Stein at an open studios event where I’d put up an epic floor to ceiling wall installation all these book pages.  The building was a gun power labyrinth of GET SMART passages and doors and long halls.  I don’t think he saw the installation,  but he found me drawing in the pages of Hemingway at the bar in my friends loft.  He said, “You are the guy I’m looking for”.</p><p>I said, “what do you mean?”</p><p>He said, “I’m a digital publisher.</p><p>I said, “Oh I think you’re the guy I’m looking for”</p><p>Because earlier a DJ had told me everything should be on the computer.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":7,"y":1,"width":5,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-digital-work-of-alex-itin","id":"de8a08a6-d04d-4eeb-b67c-2373e04e0a41","title":"Zoodoo","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/Zoodoo","type":"video","x":2,"y":3,"width":4,"height":3,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-digital-work-of-alex-itin","id":"dc82406f-713c-4ae1-aa4e-b9afe7f9dfd7","title":"Zoodoo","content":"<p>Zoodoo was Alex Itin’s first work in TK3.

However, we welcome journalists and other researchers to explore what we are offering and would appreciate feedback on how we can better meet their needs.</p><p>Unlike the <strong><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/tv\">TV News Archive</a></strong>, the three Russian language channels are not searchable by captions.  There are no captions, we don’t have Russian-to-English speech-to-text software. Currently, there is a 12-hour lag between broadcast time and availability for viewing.  We don’t have program title information, so we divide all the broadcast content into 1/2-hour increments.

And we will be convinced that just as you won the war against a particular threat to civilization you were nevertheless waging a war in favor of and for the benefit of Germans, your own enemies, just as we are convinced that if it should ever come to that kind of a confrontation, our own determination to win the struggle, will be a determination to wage a war not only for whites but also for Negroes.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":36,"y":11,"width":3,"height":3,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"baldwin-buckley-debate-100","id":"d3d9bdb5-0609-4a67-867d-90dd56cff7ac","title":"buckley national review","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20221110234217/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review","type":"waybackmachine","x":30,"y":16,"width":4,"height":6,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"baldwin-buckley-debate-100","id":"68b27db7-9c1f-433e-9777-27c04fc9c4d8","title":"buckley wikipedia","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20221117030831/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.","type":"waybackmachine","x":34,"y":16,"width":4,"height":6,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"baldwin-buckley-debate-100","id":"3310786d-74a8-4060-9672-80aa03ddff5e","title":"tapestry banner","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/download/redonebanner/redonebanner.png","type":"web","x":25,"y":3,"width":14,"height":6,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"baldwin-buckley-debate-100","id":"545a0653-041f-4a3b-82b6-c7a4d10794cf","title":"intro header","content":"<h2 style=\"height:100%;text-align:center;display:flex;align-items:center;font-size:200%;line-height:1.25;justify-content:center;\"><strong>Introduction to the debate</strong></h2>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":18,"y":4,"width":3,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-encyclopedia-project-5-fork","id":"05dd4f91-6fca-4527-b295-6141829f0ba0","title":"britannic phase text","content":"<h2><em>The Encyclopedia Britannica</em> Phase, 1980-81</h2><p>In 1980 when I was trying to figure out the next stage of my life, I spent the first six months working nights as a waiter and my days reading in the Santa Monica Library. Early on, the work being done at the Architecture Machine Group lab at MIT (e.g. the Movie Manual and the Aspen Movie Map and the interactive laserdiscs being produced by MCA/IBM (eg. The First National Kidisc) caught my attention and I decided to focus on the utterly wild idea of an Intelligent Encyclopedia that could interact with users at their level of interest and ability. In large part through blind luck I ended up being hired as a consultant to <em>Encyclopedia Brittanica</em> and got to spend six months. The luck arose as a result of a letter I wrote to Dennis Hadley at Random House inquiring about the possibility of licensing the Random House Encyclopedia. Dennis had been the sales rep who called on me when I ran Liberation Books in Seattle and went on to be the VP of sales. A friend asked me what I was into at that point in my life and I sent her a copy of the letter, completely unaware (honest) that her father was on Britannica’s board. She gave the letter to her father who in turn gave it to Chuck Swanson, Britannica’s CEO. Swanson called me up and said “If you know so much why don’t you come talk to us.” In reality at that point I didn’t know much of anything, but i found the one guy in the U.S., Rod Daynes at the University of Nebraska, who had made a bunch of interactive discs for the CIA and invited him to go with me to Chicago to do a presentation for Swanson and Charles van Doren (yes the Quiz Show contestant) who was the head of editorial. Rod Daynes put on a flawless demonstration and I got hired to write the paper below with Charles van Doren as my editor and project cheerleader.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":5,"y":4,"width":4,"height":5,"linksTo":["4baaa0e0-7679-4b26-9d6a-9c9b2ec1bfbc","2688b0eb-353d-49e5-a9a7-98dba1a2a440","4402d776-9553-4263-90bb-596b02c1e4b9","09fc126f-421f-488e-899c-a4e7ecaf8298"],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-encyclopedia-project-5-fork","id":"3cd4efdf-a677-4ec2-8beb-94ebb43b2c4a","title":"EB paper text","content":"<h2><em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>  and </h2><h2>The Intellectual Tools of the Future</h2><p>A key idea in this paper, that propelled my work forward for the next many years was a new definition of a book -- one which  focused on the way a book is USED, rather than its physical nature. I realized that in 1981 books might be considered a user-controlled medium because readers controlled both pace and sequence of access; in contrast to audio and video which at that time were entirely producer-controlled in that pace and sequence was set by the maker. But this was the moment that digital control was becoming a factor in all audio and video playback meaning that all media would soon start to resemble books in terms of user-control. That plus the understanding that the internet and artificial intelligence were coming made the moment seem ripe for a daring re-conception of what learning could be in the digital era.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":5,"y":10,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-encyclopedia-project-5-fork","id":"029f0484-60d6-4579-b096-c5426be60730","title":"Atari documents text","content":"<h2>The Atari Documents 1981-83</h2><p>When I finished the Britannica gig I basically sent the paper to anyone I thought might be interested enough to hire me to work on a related project.

Alan invited me up to Atari, read all 120 pages while i was sitting there, looked up and said, “This is exactly the sort of project I want to work on here.

FORM & CONTENT OVER TIME","content":"<p><strong>Alex Hollender</strong> headed up the team responsible for redesigning the Wikipedia desktop interface. The new version was released this past January after several years of effort. Hollender wrote detailed notes on the project and process (see item to the right). To the right of Hollender&#x27;s notes are three design documents he references plus a third-party review.</p><p></p><p><strong>The original idea</strong> for this tapestry was simply to make it easy to survey the changes in the Wikipedia&#x27;s visual interface over time. But when I chose the article on the &quot;history of slavery&quot; as an example and tracked it over twenty years, it occurred to me that the same tapestry could be used to study how the content of a key subject evolved over time. Knowledge is not static. And tracking how understanding changes provides crucial insight into the subject and broader human perspective. If you want to go deeply into this I suggest clicking on the View History button which enables you to see each and every edit made over the past decades. I wish this feature were implemented in a way that focused on major points of disagreement as that is where learning and the making of new understanding takes place.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":2,"y":1,"width":4,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork","id":"a9b41360-c4a1-4e53-8cf3-5c1dfbb366ef","title":"Alex Hollender: Design notes on the 2023 Wikipedia redesign","content":"","url":"https://alexhollender.com/wikipedia-2023-redesign?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew","type":"web","x":7,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork","id":"5783020f-9b11-48a7-96a6-9679d64c3b73","title":"Skin:Vector/2022/Design documentation","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230326184727/https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector/2022/Design_documentation","type":"waybackmachine","x":14,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork","id":"bb88d0c3-ee1a-42b5-b321-d599a7d84e17","title":"Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements/Repository/A History of Wiki Skins","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230320092658/https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements/Repository/A_History_of_Wiki_Skins","type":"waybackmachine","x":21,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork","id":"3d200d87-8646-4e21-b0cd-e3a8cf388580","title":"Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Deployment of Vector (2022)","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230327190641/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deployment_of_Vector_(2022)","type":"waybackmachine","x":28,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork","id":"59362782-da08-4396-817d-5961946dc10a","title":"Wikipedia’s Redesign Is Barely Noticeable.

FORM & CONTENT OVER TIME","content":"<p style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:1.5;\"><strong>Alex Hollender</strong> headed up the team responsible for redesigning the Wikipedia desktop interface. The new version was released this past January after several years of effort. Hollender wrote detailed notes on the project and process (see item to the right). To the right of Hollender&#x27;s notes are three design documents he references plus a third-party review.</p><p style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:1.5;\"><strong>The original idea</strong> for this tapestry was simply to make it easy to survey the changes in the Wikipedia&#x27;s visual interface over time. But when I chose the article on the &quot;history of slavery&quot; as an example and tracked it over twenty years, it occurred to me that the same tapestry could be used to study how the content of a key subject evolved over time. Knowledge is not static. And tracking how understanding changes provides crucial insight into the subject and broader human perspective. If you want to go deeply into this I suggest clicking on the View History button which enables you to see each and every edit made over the past decades. I wish this feature were implemented in a way that focused on major points of disagreement as that is where learning and the making of new understanding takes place.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":2,"y":1,"width":4,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork-fork","id":"de9aa47c-8adf-4137-a509-f067b2512b13","title":"Alex Hollender: Design notes on the 2023 Wikipedia redesign","content":"","url":"https://alexhollender.com/wikipedia-2023-redesign?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew","type":"web","x":7,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork-fork","id":"48b96119-845a-4443-9249-e64ba155b02d","title":"Skin:Vector/2022/Design documentation","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230326184727/https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector/2022/Design_documentation","type":"waybackmachine","x":14,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork-fork","id":"bbf21d94-fb82-434d-bd53-4690c9b0bc4a","title":"Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements/Repository/A History of Wiki Skins","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230320092658/https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements/Repository/A_History_of_Wiki_Skins","type":"waybackmachine","x":21,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork-fork","id":"80e06a95-6dee-4b08-b50b-0cba95903d6b","title":"Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Deployment of Vector (2022)","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230327190641/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deployment_of_Vector_(2022)","type":"waybackmachine","x":28,"y":1,"width":6,"height":7,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"wikipedia-over-time-form-content-fork-fork","id":"933ca4f7-bcaa-4fec-af39-825d35b6c055","title":"Wikipedia’s Redesign Is Barely Noticeable.
