Now with the situation in the Ukraine, we find ourselves trying to understand what’s happening and the history that led up to it. I’m fascinated to realize how much I’m relying on text — articles, essays, twitter feeds etc. — to provide the nuanced exploration of complex and abstract ideas i’m looking for, practically in real-time.  Video may help me identify with the suffering of the Ukranian people, but it seems to skim along the surface, manipulating emotions rather than digging deep for understanding.</p><p>Yesterday I read four articles, quite different in perspective and even topic, which I thought gave me some insight into what’s going on. What’s remarkable is that when compared to the limited range of voices of the pre-internet era, these four articles are only a tiny fraction of the breathtaking range of voices now available on the internet. And this is right on time because the complexity of the current moment is such that we need a broad array of lenses through which we can look; not that truth is relative, but rather that truth is inevitably a collage of perspectives which depend on the collision of multiple viewpoints.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, I’m putting the four articles here for two reasons. Some of you may find them interesting and worth the read. And also, as a way of connecting to the ongoing conversation about the evolution of media in the networked era. What better time to talk than right now when we’re in the middle of it.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe1"],"hideTitle":true},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe1","title":"New Inquiry","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220301183313/https%3A%2F%2Fthenewinquiry.com%2Fblog%2Fa-very-long-winter%2F","type":"web","x":3,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe2"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe2","title":"Counterpunch","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220301202219/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.counterpunch.org%2F2022%2F03%2F01%2Famerica-defeats-germany-for-the-third-time-in-a-century%2F","type":"web","x":5,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe3"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe3","title":"NoahOpinion","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220302150550/https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/beyond-sanctions-an-off-ramp-for","type":"web","x":7,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe4"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe4","title":"Guardian","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220303063834/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2022%2Fmar%2F02%2Fcivilised-european-look-like-us-racist-coverage-ukraine%3FCMP%3DShare_iOSApp_Other","type":"web","x":9,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark1","title":"BBC report","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220302030251/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60562240","type":"web","x":1,"y":1,"width":2,"height":5,"linksTo":["mark2"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark2","title":"","content":"<h3 style=\"color:black;\">References:</h3>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":3,"y":3,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":["mark3"],"hideTitle":true},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark3","title":"Archived ria.ru page","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html","type":"web","x":4,"y":1,"width":2,"height":5,"linksTo":["mark4"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark4","title":"","content":"<h3 style=\"color:black;\">Which was archived because of several archiving projects:</h3>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":6,"y":3,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":["mark5"],"hideTitle":true},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark5","title":"Wayback Machine projects","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/collections/*/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html","type":"web","x":7,"y":1,"width":2,"height":5,"linksTo":["mark6"],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark6","title":"","content":"<h3 style=\"color:black;\">And this Tweet:</h3>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":9,"y":3,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":["mark7"],"hideTitle":true},{"tapestryId":"marktapestry","id":"mark7","title":"Tweet from Christo Grozev","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220303131315/https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1498026581704519684?s=21","type":"web","x":10,"y":1,"width":2,"height":2,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false},{"tapestryId":"maker-made-tapestry","id":"9bd9e16e-c36e-453a-86cb-53423367cc5d","title":"maker1","content":"Hi!
