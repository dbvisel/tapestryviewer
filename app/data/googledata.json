Now with the situation in the Ukraine, we find ourselves trying to understand what’s happening and the history that led up to it. I’m fascinated to realize how much I’m relying on text — articles, essays, twitter feeds etc. — to provide the nuanced exploration of complex and abstract ideas i’m looking for, practically in real-time.  Video may help me identify with the suffering of the Ukranian people, but it seems to skim along the surface, manipulating emotions rather than digging deep for understanding.</p><p>Yesterday I read four articles, quite different in perspective and even topic, which I thought gave me some insight into what’s going on. What’s remarkable is that when compared to the limited range of voices of the pre-internet era, these four articles are only a tiny fraction of the breathtaking range of voices now available on the internet. And this is right on time because the complexity of the current moment is such that we need a broad array of lenses through which we can look; not that truth is relative, but rather that truth is inevitably a collage of perspectives which depend on the collision of multiple viewpoints.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, I’m putting the four articles here for two reasons. Some of you may find them interesting and worth the read. And also, as a way of connecting to the ongoing conversation about the evolution of media in the networked era. What better time to talk than right now when we’re in the middle of it.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":2,"height":4,"linksTo":["webframe1"],"hideTitle":true,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"bobtapestry","id":"webframe1","title":"New

She had been fired only the before for refusing to work because her father was ill.\n\nSeltzer: in 1911 I went into work to the Triangle and at that time, I made there already $12 a week. The shop there, was tremendous, it was three or four flights. In the shop, you know, we were piecework. It was very, very hard work. And it was in a terrible, terrible sweatshop. It was absolutely unbearable. Production there was like, they were standing in the back of you, and watching you every minute, what you worked and they drive like a slave. The doors were locked. No fire escape. \n\nEvery night, when we used to go out of the shop, it used to be a group of girls are there from the shop, like you know, hired that they should examine you, your bosom, your panties, you’re anything, if you don’t take out any lace, or cotton, or a blouse. They used to, the men used to be examined and the women used to be examined.\n\nAt that time, it was on Friday and I couldn’t work overtime — my father was very sick, really sick, he got emphysema and he coughed an awful lot, and I had a lot of problems and couldn’t work, you know, overtime. They expected me to work. So I came to the foreman and I said to him, “I can’t work overtime, I. . . “ He said, “Get out! And don’t come back in tomorrow.” so I didn’t, so I went out . . . \n\nInterviewer: How much time of overtime where are you expected to work?\n\nSeltzer: well, you hadda work, you used to work from six till eight o’clock. You know, till you get home, it was nine o’clock, because the walking home two hours . . . \n\nInterviewer: and what kind of work did you do there, specifically?\n\nSeltzer: Specif . . . a machine. You know, working a machine, blouses. And I came home. And tomorrow was the fire. And that time, I’ll never forget it. I . . . you sit with young people nine months, machine by machine you know. Others, the right machine is from this side, and across the way it was another machine. And you got acquainted for nine months with young people. They had, some of them, had diamond rings - they're supposed to get married in June. The boys used to work daytime and go at night to school and they had the hopes they’ll be an engineer, they’ll be a doctor, they’ll be a lawyer – they’ll be something. You know, young, intelligent children, each and everyone of them, was no dumbbells. \n\nAnd the fire broke out. They locked, the doors were locked. There was no fire escape we had to escape, or no door to open. 146 children were burned and not to recognize and except…\n\nHundreds and hundreds of people were taken to the hospitals. They spraying from the windows, down, you know? Oh, it was a tragedy for years and years.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience, produced by Gail pellet (New York: WBAI, 1976).","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":1,"y":1,"width":3,"height":2,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"67830f6b-0e71-4d7f-b235-17c107b64273","title":"Interview With Ida Seltzer, A Survivor Of The Triangle Fire 1911","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/interview-with-ida-seltzer-a-survivor-of-the-triangle-fire-1911","type":"audio","x":4,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"889711af-f5ea-4a0a-b291-3df64065f7cc","title":"Computers as theatre","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/computersasthea000laur/mode/1up","type":"book","x":4,"y":2,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"58d970c0-429a-440d-a3b8-1bcb85472424","title":"Item 4","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/details/centuryofwomen00feld/page/48/mode/2up?q=triangle+shirtwaist&view=theater","type":"book","x":7,"y":1,"width":3,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"a4661ed2-5926-4fdf-adcd-6be78815702b","title":"A century of women : the most influential events in twentieth-century women's history","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/centuryofwomen00feld/page/48/mode/2up?q=triangle+shirtwaist&view=theater","type":"book","x":5,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"monday-morning-fork","id":"ff18e960-8956-4b45-95bb-926383ab5ea6","title":"Item 6","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220301202219/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.counterpunch.org%2F2022%2F03%2F01%2Famerica-defeats-germany-for-the-third-time-in-a-century%2F","type":"web","x":1,"y":4,"width":3,"height":6,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"c1a57963-9761-4bb8-b658-b89f6daac76a","title":"first version","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220321085516/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":1,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"8adc6a2e-b802-4c73-a5b3-6d33e278ab9e","title":"March 22","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220322052640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":2,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"china-eastern-airlines-flight-5735","id":"47bc3219-af33-473e-b440-d56f8d6b0b70","title":"March 23","content":"","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220323231403/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735","type":"web","x":3,"y":1,"width":1,"height":1,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"microscopes-are-prudent","id":"f9f03a05-eb52-4d97-bba1-669ba669843b","title":"Introduction","content":"<p>I went and searched the Internet Archive for Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Faith is a Fine Invention&quot; curious about how much diversity there might be in the results.

I was an old yeller even in my youth.  So I did a long series of drawing nights at the Galapagos club in Williamsburg where I would take a text:  say <em>Frankenstein</em> on Halloween and try to draw the room.  Everyone in it.  It had some relation to Joyce and the idea that if you put a focus on anyone on the street there was a novel there.  We are all a great epic story and also I suppose sort of boring and a sameness of crowd. Also if you obscured some or most of the text a randomly generated poem would appear in the margins. It was  maybe Bowie by Burroughs by way of the Dadas….. or the obvious.  Anyway if you knew the book even just a few of the words would glow with the nostalgia of a lost love, or so I supposed.  The DJ said this is so great because no one reads anymore.</p><p>I would attempt to sell these pages for 5 dollars which was the price of a beer at Galapagos. Mostly people just bought me a beer and took a page as souvenir,  or just bought me a  beer and listened to me talk.  There was a large element of performance;  some didacticism,  some advocacy for things I liked.  I hoped people who took a page would feel compelled to read the book it was on.  This was naive I think and not all that many took pages any way so soon I had a large library of drawings.</p><p>I met Bob Stein at an open studios event where I’d put up an epic floor to ceiling wall installation all these book pages.  The building was a gun power labyrinth of GET SMART passages and doors and long halls.  I don’t think he saw the installation,  but he found me drawing in the pages of Hemingway at the bar in my friends loft.  He said, “You are the guy I’m looking for”.</p><p>I said, “what do you mean?”</p><p>He said, “I’m a digital publisher.</p><p>I said, “Oh I think you’re the guy I’m looking for”</p><p>Because earlier a DJ had told me everything should be on the computer.</p>","url":"","type":"textFrame","x":7,"y":1,"width":5,"height":4,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-digital-work-of-alex-itin","id":"de8a08a6-d04d-4eeb-b67c-2373e04e0a41","title":"Zoodoo","content":"","url":"https://archive.org/embed/Zoodoo","type":"video","x":2,"y":3,"width":4,"height":3,"linksTo":[],"hideTitle":false,"thumbnail":"https://ia601502.us.archive.org/24/items/Zoodoo/Zoodoo.mov","controlList":[]},{"tapestryId":"the-digital-work-of-alex-itin","id":"dc82406f-713c-4ae1-aa4e-b9afe7f9dfd7","title":"Zoodoo","content":"<p>Zoodoo was Alex Itin’s first work in TK3.
